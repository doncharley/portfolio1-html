    <h2>Childhood</h2>
    Born and raised in the mainland part of the bustling city of Lagos, Nigeria. My first ambition as a child was to be an architech, snce i had a natural interest in art and structures.
    
    <h2>Education</h2>
    I did my elemetary, secondary school and a diploma in computer appreciation, graphics and desktop publishing. I also did a bit of engineering but stopped midway to work in a publishing company when the opportunity presented itself.

    Later on, several attempts were made to further my studies in several higher institutions of learning but to no avail. Meanwhile, I worked my uncle at his medical laboratory, as a lab technician since i graduated as a science student from high school.<p/>
    
    <p>At the moment, I'm a full stack blockchain developer and pioneer of the web3 media brand Blockchain Monie</p>
